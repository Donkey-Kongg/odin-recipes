        <h1>Chicken Taquitos</h1>
        <img src="../images/taquitos.jpg">
        <p>This recipe uses canned or rotisserie chicken, cheese, and hot pepper sauce. The filling is easy to adjust — add sliced jalapeños if you prefer lots of heat. Bake until crisp and serve as an appetizer or side dish with your favorite salsa.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can chicken chunks, drained or 1 1/4 cups rotisserie chicken, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>5 drops hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco), or more to taste</li>
            <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Combine chicken and cheese in a bowl; stir in hot pepper sauce to taste.</li>
            <li>Warm tortillas one at a time in a skillet over medium heat until flexible, about 10 seconds per side.</li>
            <li>Spread about 1 heaping tablespoonful of chicken mixture over half of a warmed tortilla. Roll tightly to form a taquito starting at the filled side of the tortilla. Place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden crisp and to your liking, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
